            <p>Thanks for making it this far into my portfolio website! I'm currently pursuing UX/UI design as a career. I became interested in this field after years of scouring lists of potential career paths. Although I was interested in STEM, I wanted to find a job that also allowed for creative freedom. There was difficulty finding a job that had a perfect mix of technology and art, until I stumbled upon UX/UI design. This field presents a unique balance that allows me to design with a purpose and goal. Especially after working with Figma, I developed a passion for making elements animate, and creating a flow between frames.</p>

            <h3>My Design Pillars</h3>
            <div id="pillars">
                <div>
                    <h4>Usability is key.</h4>
                    <p>The Patricia Moore's quote, "Stop designing for disability and start designing for usability," greatly influenced my design approach. I aim to create designs that are accessible to everyone and promote a positive and inclusive experience for all users.</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h4>Learning is a collaborative process.</h4>
                    <p>There will be ideas and perspectives that others can offer an alternative and further the project's success. I value keeping an open mind to others' voices and input.</p>
