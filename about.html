            <h2>My story!</h2>
            <p>Thanks for making it this far into my portfolio website! During years of scouring lists of potential career paths, I was interested in STEM, but I wanted to find a job that also allowed for creative freedom. There was difficulty finding a job that had a perfect mix of technology and art, until I stumbled upon UX/UI design. This field presents a unique balance that allows me to design with for the better of the user. Throughout my years of experience with design, I developed a passion for prototyping and streamlining user experiences. As my graduation at UC Davis with Bachelor's Degrees in Design and Communications draws closer, I'm seeking full-time UX/UI design opportunities. </p>

                <div>
                    <h4>Usability is key.</h4>
                    <p>Patricia Moore's quote, "Stop designing for disability and start designing for usability," greatly influenced my design approach. I aim to create designs that are accessible to everyone and promote an inclusive experience for all users.</p>

                <div>
                    <h4>Learning is a collaborative process.</h4>
                    <p>There will be ideas and perspectives that others can offer an alternative and further the project's success. I value keeping an open mind to others' voices and input.</p>
