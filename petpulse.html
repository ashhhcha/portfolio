        <h3>Project Overview.</h3>
        <p>All paper records, scattered digital files, and pet health information can be consolidated into a single app with Pet Pulse. Through rigorous research and analysis, our team designed an interactive prototype facilitating seamless management of pet healthcare records and appointments. Our solution meets the diverse needs of pet owners while increasing access to vital veterinary services.</p>
        <p>Through six weeks, my team and I had weekly sprints with Project Manager Karen Dang providing feedback and critiques, ending with a presentation to a panel of industry professionals and over 50 students.</p>

        <div>
            <h4>User Research</h4>
            <p>My first approach was discovering the issues pet owners face with the healthcare platforms. My team and I conducted comparative analysis to note the strengths, weaknesses, and opportunities about the experiences and interfaces for the UC Davis Veterinary Hospital, Blue Pearl Pet Hospital, VCA Animal Hospital.</p>
            <p>To learn more about the needs, wants, and struggles of pet owners, I distributed a survey to 50 pet owners and conducted 8 user interviews. <b>Users noted they struggled with medical record keeping, navigating current veterinary service interfaces.</b></p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="quotes">
        
            <blockquote>"I'm usually too stressed about how [my dog] is doing to <b>keep track of a stack of papers</b> when she's sick."
                <span>&#8212; Participant A</span>
            </blockquote>
        
            <blockquote>"<b>Setting up an appointment is annoying</b>. I either have to call and hope they pick up, or go through a too-many-step process online."
                <span>&#8212; Participant B</span>

                <p>There were <b>financial</b>, <b>transporation</b>, and <b>accessibility</b> barriers, <b>overload</b> in existing platforms, <b>communication</b> challenges, as well as a demand for <b>remote</b> healthcare tools.</p>

        <h3>To the drawing board.</h3>
        <h4>Sketches</h4>
        <p>With ideas surrounding decreasing stress and increasing efficiency in pet healthcare, I created sketches of potential screens for record keeping, clinic finding, appointment scheduling, pet profile editing, and vet messaging.</p>

        <h3>&#9995; Pause!</h3>
        <p>Pet health is a broad topic, and there was <b>difficulty narrowing down the direction</b> my team and I wanted the app to go in. Record keeping, appointment scheduling, and vet messaging made it to later iterations. However, we decided to reduce our focus on the clinic finding aspect, as we felt that kind of research was not central to our app's purpose.</p>

        <h3>Presenting to the panel.</h3>
        <p>My team and I were judged by Neha Deshmukh, a UX Designer at Amazon. Her feedback was incredibly valuable, emphasizing our research strengths and guiding us to refine problem definition when implementing educational aspects of the app. After presenting to a panel of 4 other judges, my team and I won the Best Overall Design Award out of our cohort.</p>

                <h4>Narrowing the scope</h4>
                <p>In the ideation phase of this project, I had difficulties identifying the design's purpose. Healthcare is a broad category, and our team could tackle different aspects of the topic. By continuously revisiting and focusing on the results from the surveys and interviews, I established a clearer direction for the app.</p>

                <h4>Team communication</h4>
                <p>With a broad topic and 6-week deadline, communication between team members was important throughout the design process. My team and I made sure to discuss our action items and progress during meetings to ensure everyone was aligned with the project's direction and goals.</p>
