                <h1>Mind the Gap</h1>
                <p>This interactive web prototype uses questions of different topics and vulnerability levels to allow first- and second-generation Taiwanese Americans better understand the each other's values, beliefs, and behaviors. Over the span of two academic quarters, I worked with UC Davis faculty to create this project.</p>

                <h2>The Problem</h2>
                <p>Many first- and second-generation Asian American families experience difficulty connecting due to children adapting to the new culture faster than their immigrant parents. However, parents who still hold on to their traditional values and behaviors expect their children to do the same. The division creates intergenerational cultural conflict, leading to diminished mental health in children, according to previous research. Taiwanese Americans are not exempt from this occurrence.</p>
            </div>

        </article>
        <article>
            <h2>Project Goals</h2>
                <p>The objective of this interactive web project is to create an environment encouraging conversations among Taiwanese American individuals and their families, aiming to provide better comprehension of common intergenerational cultural conflict and mitigate tension within the community.</p>
        </article>
        <article>
            <h2>How Might I?</h2>
                <p>My project explores how I might prototype a digital interactive project available on the web to enhance the experiences associated with intergenerational communication between Taiwanese American parents and children.</p>
        </article>
        <article class="researchCuz">
            <h2>User Research</h2>
            <p>I started the project by focusing on research to learn why immediate families experience intergenerational cultural conflict. I sifted through books and the online catalogue at the Peter J. Shield Library.</p>
            <div>
                <h3>Literature Review</h3>
                <p>Two key points I learned which structured my approach to questions were:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Asian American Values Scale noted differences between first-generation Asian Americans and later generations in the adherence to Asian cultural values of “collectivism, conformity to norms, emotional self-control, family recognition through achievement, and humility” (Kim et al., 2005).</li>
                        <li>Asian Americans used indirect communication to protect group harmony (Leong et al., 2017) to maintain face.</li>
                    </ul>

            <h3>Getting to Know My Users</h3>
            <p>To learn about the various first-hand experiences of Taiwanese American families, I surveyed four first-generation Taiwanese American parents and interviewed nine second-generation Taiwanese American children. </p>

            <h3>&#9995; Uh Oh!</h3>
            <p>After compiling my interview findings, I noticed there was a misalignment of perspectives in the literature review. The written sources referenced relationships between parents and children with a negative lens. However, the interviews of second-generation Taiwanese Americans had an overall healthier relationship with their parents.</p>
        </article>
        <article class="innerP2">
            <h3>Back to the Drawing Board</h3>
            <p>Unsure and confused about the direction of the project, I drew out the Golden Circle to reorient my approach. </p>

            <div>
                <p>I realized I was struggling with solving the 'how' aspect of the problem, and decided to draw a mind map to work out the differences between conflicting findings. How can the negative experiences referenced in the literature review work with the positive ones I found in the interviews?</p>            
                <p>I noted the small similarities between the generations and key points I want to focus on in the project.  </p></div>

            <h3>Who Am I Talking To?</h3>
            <p>Based on the literature review and interviews, I created two user personas to anchor the perspectives my project will cover.</p>
            <div class="userPerDescrip">
                <div>
                    <p><b>Lina</b> is a first-generation Taiwanese American who wants to connect with her children more.</p>

                <p>To synthesize the design, I created a task flow to understand the particular pages I needed to create.</p>
                <p>Doing so helped me plan the elements I would need for each screen without spending excessive time reiterating the wireframes.</p>

            <h2>Ideation</h2>
            <h3>Low Fidelity Sketches</h3>
            <p>I drew rough preliminary sketches to iterate the base designs of the interactive website. Visualizing the initial design allowed me to see how I can further develop it.</p>
            <img class="innerP3" src="images/thesis/lowfid.png" alt="low fidelity">

            <h3>Middle Fidelity</h3>
            <p>In Figma, I planned out particular elements and features I wanted to include. I shifted away from the layered cards in the responses page because it wasn't intuitive for the user to click them.</p>

            <h3>&#9995; Don't Forget About Me!</h3>
            <p>After discussing with Professor Meg Quarton, I was encouraged to consider incorporating my experiences as a second-generation Taiwanese American into the project. I should take a look at how I communicate with my own family. </p>
        </article>

        <p>At this point in the project, the biggest takeaway was learning how to work with conflicting points of research. To address the loss of direction, I focused on the purpose and goal of the project, and ideated how my work could address both by utilizing information from the literature review and user interviews.</p>

        <article class="visDes">
            <h2>Visual Design</h2>
            <p>To relax the user, I opted for a calm visual design with minimal distractions. I wanted to maintain a clean look while evoking nostalgia through references to Taiwanese design.</p>

            <div class="set">
                <div>
                    <h3>Font</h3>
                    <p>To follow the flow of the Traditional Chinese font, I used Noto Sans TC. This allows the Chinese and English characters to be similar to each other, suggesting continuity and connection between the two languages that are spoken between the generations. The font itself is also easily legible for header and body text.</p>

                <img  src="images/thesis/colors.png" alt="colors">
                <p>The cream color is from a Taiwanese book cover which uses natural elements, giving it a serene feeling. I used a dark gray as the text to compliment the cream color.</p>
                <p>The emerald green and golden brown are two out of the three iconic colors listed by the Ministry of Culture of Taiwan. I included these colors to reference the natural elements and values of Taiwan.</p>
            </div>
            

            
            <div>
                <h3>Food Motif</h3>
                <p>The design contains an underlying food motif. Food is a communicator between generations as various dishes hold personal memories. Even consuming the same dish bonds people together with the experience and act of eating.</p>

        <article>
            <h2>High Fidelity</h2>
            <p>I implemented references to food, while keeping a minimalistic design. Users should focus on the responses, so I changed the response page to display all writing. I also included a warm-up question so users experience less of a cognitive jump when they begin to answer more personal questions with their family.</p>

        <article>
            <h2>User Testing</h2>
            <p>I asked a few participants to explore and complete a sample pathway of the project. Overall, the participants enjoyed the references to food and the overall visual design. As for the critical feedback, users noted the following:</p>
