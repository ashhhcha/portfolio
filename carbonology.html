                <h2>The Problem</h2>
                <p>With the lack of education, convenient access, and financial incentive to recycle, taking a step towards a sustainable lifestyle may seem daunting to people. Identifying recyclable items can be confusing, and finding nearby recycling facilities can pose an inconvenience. There is also no encouragement or motivation to alter their behavior to begin recycling.</p>
            </div>

        <article class="research">
            <h2>User Research</h2>
            <blockquote>"...94% of Americans support recycling, and 74% say it should be a top priority. But only about 35% of people actually recycle." - American Broadcasting Company (ABC)
            </blockquote>
            <div>
                <h3>Surveys</h3>
                <p>To gather more information, I started off with surveying people on their habits of recycling and conscious purchases. I asked them questions about:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>The frequency of which they recycle</li>
                        <li>Their perspective on sustainability</li>
                        <li>Their consideration of carbon footprint when purchasing items</li>
                        <li>Their thoughts on why Americans do not recycle</li>
                    </ol>
            </div>

            <div>
                <h3>Affinity Mapping</h3>
                <p>I complied participants' survey responses and categorized two common problems I noted individuals faced: education and financial issues. I used an affinity map to organize their thoughts.</p>

            <div>
                <h3>Secondary Research</h3>
                <p>To better understand the attitudes of people who recycle, I explored studies and articles on their perceptions towards recycling and learned that financial incentives can affect behavior towards recycling and there is confusion towards the process of recycling.</p>
                <blockquote>"Financial incentives are more effective for among consumers with lower levels of environmental knowledge, while nonfinancial incentives are more effective among consumers with higher levels" (Li, 2021)</blockquote>
                <blockquote>“While done with good intentions, many Americans are practicing aspirational recycling – tossing things into recycling bins that they think should be recycled, rather than what can be recycled.” - Dr. Paul Gilman, chief sustainability officer at Covanta</blockquote>
                <p>After summarizing the data and research, we focused on addressing the three main factors that contributed to the lack of recycling:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>No incentive to recycle</li>
                        <li>Lack of education</li>
                        <li>Lack of convenient access</li>
                    </ol>

            <h3>Low Fidelity</h3>
            <p>After much discussion about what features we wanted to include, I drafted a quick sketch that encompassed everyone's ideas. I wanted to ensure this app included effective features that addressed the factors of incentives, education, and convenient access to lack of recycling.</p>

            <h3>Visual Design</h3>
            <p>Carbonology primarily uses green due to the color's frequent association with the environment. The app also includes various tints and shades of green and purple to create a calming color palette with cool tone colors. Open Sans was chosen for its easy readability.</p>

                        <h4>Importance of research</h4>
                        <p>In the user research portion of the project, I learned the importance of utilizing secondary research in your design. While interviews can help give you a good idea about the components of your design, there will be details that may be left out. When ideating solutions regarding science and sustainability, secondary research can provide scientific information about the user, and cover the gaps from primary research.</p>

                        <h4>Collaboration</h4>
                        <p>Because the given prompt was broad, the ideation stage of this project was challenging to navigate through. Each teammate had a unique pitch for the app. As a result, this method of collaboration was able to consider and address the issues that users faced. Without the inclusion of all ideas, the app would not have developed as thoroughly to expand on the problems regarding recycling. This collaboration demonstrated to me the importance of taking into account your teammates' thoughts and perspectives to further the design and achieve project goals.</p>
